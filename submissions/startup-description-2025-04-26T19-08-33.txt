EcoCart is an innovative San Francisco-based startup founded in 2019 that seamlessly integrates carbon emissions software with e-commerce platforms. Their technology allows shoppers to select carbon-neutral checkout options while shopping at major retailers like Walmart and others.

The company's unique algorithm calculates the carbon footprint of shipping for each purchase, then enables customers to offset these emissions.
