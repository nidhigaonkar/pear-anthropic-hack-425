Startup Description

ReelAI is an AI-powered video editing platform designed for freelance creators, YouTubers, and small businesses who want professional-looking videos without the time sink or high cost. Users upload raw footage, and ReelAI automatically generates multiple polished edits optimized for different platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram). The AI suggests cuts, transitions, and effects based on the target audience, trending styles, and the creator's past successful videos. Users can tweak the edits manually, but 80% of the heavy lifting — from pacing to sound syncing — is handled instantly. Our goal: democratize high-end video production for the 99% of creators who can't afford a full-time editor.
