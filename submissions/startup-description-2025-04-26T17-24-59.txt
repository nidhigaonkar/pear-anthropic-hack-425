Startup Description

Series is an AI-powered social platform revolutionizing how college students connect, without the vanity metrics that plague traditional social networks. Founded by Yale juniors Nathaneo Johnson and Sean Hargrow, Series uses AI Friends that operate directly in iMessage to make warm, double opt-in introductions based on mutual value.

Unlike Facebook and other platforms that quantify worth through likes and followers, Series creates connections only when there's genuine benefit on both sides. Users simply text their AI Friend about themselves and their needs, and the AI intelligently identifies potential matches within their extended network.

Recently securing $3M in pre-seed funding from notable investors including Parable, Pear VC, and angels like Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, Series has already processed over 32,000 messages. The platform requires a .edu email, creating a trusted ecosystem for student entrepreneurs, with plans to expand to other sectors.
